# Contribution Guidelines

Please ensure your pull request follows these guidelines.

- **Make individual pull requests for every code example or topic you want to add.**
- Search previous suggestions before adding a new one – it may be a duplicate.
- Be mindful of formatting. It's best to start with a bit of text like "Variables are ...", then a code example, then some more text explaining the example, and then some further deeper examples.
- New topics, improvements of existing code examples etc. are welcome. Remember, it's a cheatsheet, not the Swift reference guide.
- Please make jargon and Swift lingo like _nil-coalescing operator_ cursive by wrapping it in `_` underscores. Use indents or backticks for code.
- Check your spelling and grammar. Test your code in Playgrounds or a Swift Sandbox. Make sure to use the most recent Swift version.

Your contributions are always welcome! Thanks for making the world a better place :-)
